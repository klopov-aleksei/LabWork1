## Description
Lab Work 1 - "loading and processing raster images".
I studied how an image is interpreted when processed on a computer, understood how the way an image is placed in memory relates to perception human images. Also I Learnt the BMP image format and learnt to load data from files into memory. I learnt to manipulate data in memory: change and move data. I learnt to save images.
**Initial data**: A color raster image in BMP format is given.
**Output**: rotated clockwise and counterclockwise images. Image with a Gaussian filter.
